This project is a tool for the user to control his/her expenses. After login in, the user can add an expense in any of the avaliable currencies, write its description, add a payment method and assign a category. Once an expese is created, it can be edited or deleted. The total amount spent is shown in the top right corner, converted to BRL.

This project was done using Test Driven Development (TDD), a technique in which the developer first writes the tests for a funcionality before actually implementing it. The application is also responsive, so it can be used on a mobile, tablet or computer.

This application uses [this API](https://docs.awesomeapi.com.br/api-de-moedas) to fetch the exchange rates.

This project was developed while studying Front-end web development [@betrybe](https://github.com/betrybe). The files I worked on are in the ```/src``` folder. I got approval on 100% of this project's requirements.
